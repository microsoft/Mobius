Contributing Code Changes
-------------------------

If you are looking for something to work on, the list of [up-for-grabs issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/SparkCLR/labels/up%20for%20grabs) is a good starting point.

Before opening a *pull request*, review [Contributing Code Changes](/docs/project-docs/CONTRIBUTING.md). 
It lists steps that are required before creating a PR. In particular, consider:

- Is the change important and ready enough to ask the community to spend time reviewing?
- Have you searched for existing, related issues and pull requests?
- Is the change being proposed clearly explained and motivated?

Contribution License Agreement
------------------------------
We appreciate community contributions to code repositories open sourced by Microsoft. By signing a 
[contribution license agreement](https://cla.microsoft.com/cladoc/microsoft-contribution-license-agreement.pdf), we ensure that the community is free to use your contributions. 

When a contributor makes a pull request, the Microsoft Pull Request BOT (MSBOT) checks whether the change requires a CLA; for example, trivial typo fixes usually don’t require a CLA. If no CLA is required, the pull request is labeled as *cla-not-required* and the contributor is done. If the change requires a CLA, MSBOT checks whether the contributor has already signed one; if you have, the pull request is labeled as *cla-signed* and the contributor is done. If the contributor needs to sign a CLA, MSBOT will label the request as *cla-required* and post a comment pointing you to sign in on the appropriate website to sign the CLA (fully electronic, no faxing involved); once the contributor has signed a CLA, the pull request is labeled as *cla-signed*. You are done. 

We accept only pull requests that are labeled as either *cla-not-required*, *cla-signed* or *cla-already-signed*.
